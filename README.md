# German-Traffic-Sign-Detector

The following is a model trained on the GTSRB dataset that classifies german traffic signs. The structure of the model follows very similarly to the AlexNet structure. 

I have attached my jupyter notebook that details the development and training of the model, as well as some bug cases and fixes. 

To use/download the model, access the release.
